Learning Computer Vision using openCV and python

goals:
- get comformatable with openCV
- get better at python
- learn pytorch
- learn the basics of Computer Vision
- learn the basics of Machine Learning and Deep learning
- build a base to be able to continue learning through research papers
- build a project that utilizes what I have learned (ideally something with image segmentation or object tracking)

currently a mess due to trying to implement different techniques while learning.
