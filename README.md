Learning Computer Vision using openCV and python

Things I have done:
- learned about kernels for extracting feature sets
- Created a basic CNN with multiple convolution layers, pooling layers and linear layers with drop out.
- Trained my net on MINST data.
- Tracking accuracy on my net against the test dataset.

goals:
- get comformatable with openCV
- get better at python
- learn pytorch
- learn the basics of Computer Vision
- learn the basics of Machine Learning and Deep learning
- build a base to be able to continue learning through research papers
- build a project that utilizes what I have learned (ideally something with image segmentation or object tracking)

currently a mess due to trying to implement different techniques while learning.
